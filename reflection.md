I learned how higher-order functions can simplify working with arrays to calculate totals, find unique items, and filter data. 
Commenting helped me understand how to clearly explain what each part of the code does.

The most confusing part was making sure the comments clearly explained both the functionâ€™s purpose and how the higher-order functions worked,
without being too long or repetitive.
